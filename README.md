# Cashflow AI - Intelligent Financial Forecasting

**LSTM & XGBoost time-series forecasting for small business cashflow prediction**

A machine learning solution designed to help SMEs and retail businesses forecast their monthly cashflow with high accuracy. Using deep learning (LSTM) and gradient boosting (XGBoost), combined with traditional statistical methods (Prophet), this project provides intelligent decision support for financial planning.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: LSTM + XGBoost + Prophet for robust predictions
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Captures temporal patterns and seasonality
- **Scalability**: Works with any business cashflow dataset
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for prediction and model retraining
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts for trend analysis

## Project Overview
